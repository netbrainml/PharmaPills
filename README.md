# PharmaPills
PharmaPills include two software packages: PharmaVision and Pill-ID.

## PharmaVision
    Trained to detect misplaced drugs for automatic pharmaceutical filling stations. It can flag an error in a batch of drugs, and it can significantly reduce errors in prescription filling.
    
## PillID
    Trained to identify different medications from images. We trained the model so that it can recognize the same drug from different manufacturers. This software can be used to quickly identify drugs accurately even between different manufacturers.
